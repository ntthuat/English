An abstract noun is a type of Noun that 'refers to something' (am chi dieu gi do)
with which a peron cannot 'physically interact' (tac dong vat ly - o day la dong tu dung gioi tu with: physically interact with).
A noun is a person, place or thing. However, in many cases, the "thing" might be an 'intangible concept' (vo hinh khai niem)
- which means it is an abstract form of noun. In this instance, abstract means to exist apart from concrete existence.
A noun that is abstract is an aspect, concept, idea, experience, state of being, trait, quality, or other entity that cannot
be experienced with the five senses.

RECOGNIZING WHEN A NOUN IS ABSTRACT
 
'Concrete' (opposite of 'abstract') nouns are people, places, or things that we would experience with our five senses.
The abstract class is the opposite - we can never experience these nouns according to our senses. If a noun is abstract,
it describes something you cannot see, hear, touch, taste or smell.

Sometimes it can be difficult to recognize when the noun is abstract because there are a number of words that can function
in different ways.
